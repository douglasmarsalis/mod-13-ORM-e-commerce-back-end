## [![License: APACHE2.0](https://img.shields.io/badge/License:_MIT-orange)](https://opensource.org/license/mit/)

## Description
* For this project, I will build the back end for an e-commerce site. Iâ€™ll take a working Express.js API and configure it to use Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database.
* I will make sure that my code follows industry standards and is sourced correctly.
* By building this application, it has helped me to learn information on ORM, Express.js, MySQL, Sequelize, and other info.

## User Story
AS A manager at an internet retail company
I WANT a back end for my e-commerce website that uses the latest technologies
SO THAT my company can compete with other e-commerce companies

## Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN a functional Express.js API
WHEN I add my database name, MySQL username, and MySQL password to an environment variable file
THEN I am able to connect to a database using Sequelize
WHEN I enter schema and seed commands
THEN a development database is created and is seeded with test data
WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application
THEN my server is started and the Sequelize models are synced to the MySQL database
WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia Core for categories, products, or tags
THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON
WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia Core
THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete data in my database
